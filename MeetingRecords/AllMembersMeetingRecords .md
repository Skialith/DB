### Integration of Cross-Functional Achievements:

In our collaborative efforts, we successfully integrated the accomplishments from three specialized domains. The integration involved the following key developments:

1. Video Stream Extraction from Telecom's Robot to IoT:
    
    - The IoT team successfully extracted the video stream from the telecom team's robot.
    - This enabled real-time video feed transmission to the IoT components for target detection during the robot's operation.
2. Real-Time Target Detection and Treasure Image Transmission:
    
    - Using the extracted video stream, the IoT team implemented real-time target detection algorithms.
    - As the robot traversed its path, the IoT components detected targets and transmitted corresponding treasure images.
3. Display of Detected Treasures on the E-commerce Website:
    
    - The e-commerce team integrated the received treasure images onto the e-commerce website for display.
    - Customers visiting the website could now view the detected treasures in real-time, enhancing their interactive experience.

These collaborative achievements exemplify the successful fusion of expertise from different domains. By seamlessly incorporating the video stream extraction, real-time target detection, and treasure image transmission, we have created a dynamic and engaging experience for our customers on the e-commerce platform.
